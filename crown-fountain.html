            <p>Crown Fountain, also known as the "Squirting Faces" is an interactive public art installation designed by Spanish artist named Jaume Plensa, it opened in July 2004. It features two 50-foot glass block towers that project video images of the Chicago residents faces.</p>
        
            <p><strong>What makes it special:</strong>The water flows from the towers and appears to spout from the mouths of the projected faces that makes a playful and surprising effect. It is a popular subject for photographers and a common gathering place. </p>
       
            <p><strong>Fun Fact:</strong>Over 1,000 Chicago residents were filmed for the video display, representing the city's diversity.</p>
